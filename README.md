# Angular Ingredients

This library acts as a kitchen table of **ingredients** to pick and choose while baking your next Angular project. *Ingredients* mostly work independent of one another. Some will fit your recipe, some won't, like real ingredients, but luckily enough you're not forced to use them all togeher thanks to tree-shaking and a multi-entry point approach.
